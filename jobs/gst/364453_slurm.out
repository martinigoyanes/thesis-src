Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
Some weights of OpenAIGPTLMHeadModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at openai-gpt and are newly initialized: ['position_ids']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
