Some weights of the model checkpoint at s-nlp/roberta_toxicity_classifier were not used when initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
